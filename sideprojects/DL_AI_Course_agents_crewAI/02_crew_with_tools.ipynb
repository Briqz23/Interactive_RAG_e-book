       "Dear Roberta,\n",
       "\n",
       "Thank you for reaching out with your inquiry about setting up a Crew and adding memory to it. I'm here to provide you with comprehensive guidance on how to achieve this effectively using CrewAI.\n",
       "\n",
       "To add memory to your Crew in CrewAI, you need to follow a series of steps outlined in the documentation provided on our website. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Step 0: Installation**: Start by installing CrewAI and any necessary packages for your project. Make sure you have Python version >=3.10 and <=3.13. You can use the following commands:\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "   pip install crewai\n",
       "   pip install 'crewai[tools]'\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Step 1: Assemble Your Agents**: Define your agents with distinct roles, backstories, and enhanced capabilities like memory usage. You can create agents with memory by specifying the `memory=True` parameter in the agent creation process. Here's an example code snippet:\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "   # Creating a senior researcher agent with memory\n",
       "   researcher = Agent(\n",
       "     role='Senior Researcher',\n",
       "     goal='Uncover groundbreaking technologies in {topic}',\n",
       "     verbose=True,\n",
       "     memory=True,\n",
       "     backstory=\"Driven by curiosity...\"\n",
       "   )\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Step 3: Form the Crew**: Combine your agents into a crew and set the workflow process they'll follow to accomplish tasks. You can enable memory for the crew by specifying `memory=True` in the crew creation process. Here's an example code snippet:\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "   # Forming the crew with memory\n",
       "   crew = Crew(\n",
       "     agents=[researcher, writer],\n",
       "     tasks=[research_task, write_task],\n",
       "     process=Process.sequential,\n",
       "     memory=True,\n",
       "     cache=True,\n",
       "     max_rpm=100,\n",
       "     share_crew=True\n",
       "   )\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Step 4: Kick It Off**: Initiate the process with your crew ready. Input variables will be interpolated into the agents and tasks for a personalized approach. Here's an example code snippet:\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "   result = crew.kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'AI in healthcare'})\n",
       "   print(result)\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "\n",
       "By following these steps, you'll be able to set up a Crew in CrewAI with memory capabilities, allowing your agents to store and access information for improved performance and efficiency.\n",
