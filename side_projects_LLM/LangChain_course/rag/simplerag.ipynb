Down the Rabbit-Hole\\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she\\nhad peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a\\nbook,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”\\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid),\\nwhether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when\\nsuddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her .\", metadata={'source': 'alice_in_wonderland.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\\nwondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its\\nwaistcoat-pocket , and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity , she\\nran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.', metadata={'source': 'alice_in_wonderland.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.\\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way , and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had\\nnot a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly , for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and\\nto wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was\\ntoo dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and\\nbook-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves\\nas she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like\\nto drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all\\nthink me at home! Why , I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell of f the top of the house!” (Which was very likely\\ntrue.)\\nDown, down, down. W ould the fall never  come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said\\naloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I\\nthink—” (for , you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was\\nnot a very good opportunity for showing of f her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her , still it was good practice\\nto say it over) “—yes, that’ s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice', metadata={'source': 'alice_in_wonderland.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='to say it over) “—yes, that’ s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice\\nhad no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either , but thought they were nice grand words to say .)\\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through  the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the\\npeople that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening,\\nthis time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you\\nknow . Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying  as\\nyou’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for\\nasking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-\\nnight, I should think!” (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish\\nyou were down here with me! There are no mice in the air , I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’ s very like a\\nmouse, you know . But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy , and went on saying to\\nherself, in a dreamy sort of way , “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for , you see,\\nas she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing of f, and\\nhad just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly , “Now , Dinah,\\ntell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly , thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry\\nleaves, and the fall was over .', metadata={'source': 'alice_in_wonderland.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
